Enables use of **autolink**, **#hashtags** and **@author** links on your posts. **Links are not directed to twitter. They provide this functionality on your site.**

== Description ==

This plugin automatically converts **hashtags** (like #wordpress) to tag links, **@links** to author links (like @shailan), and autolinks URIs (like http://shailan.com ) to links. Some benefits of Twitterify are:

 * Linking will take less time, you will get more productive.
 * Tag links will be fine even if you change tag permalinks later on.
 * All links in the content will automatically have nofollow attributes.

== Installation ==

 1. Download the widget and upload it to your server through `WP Admin -> Plugins -> Add New -> Upload`
 1. Activate the plugin when the plugin is uploaded. 
 1. No settings required.
